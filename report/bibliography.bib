   abstract = { PurposeThe aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic impact of mutated TP53 in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) whose tumors were infected with human papillomavirus (HPV).MethodsThirty-two HPV-positive OSCC patients were included. Most of them were clinically classified as stage III (n=29). All patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy (follow-up from 12 to 60 months, median 32). There were 21 relapses. DNA was isolated by phenol extraction from tumor tissue. HPV DNA (type 16, 18, 31, 33) was detected in genomic DNA of the tumors by the PCR-PAGE method. TP53 mutations (exons 4–8) were detected by the PCR-SSCP method.ResultsA statistically significant difference in the number of relapses in HPV-infected (13/21) versus HPV-infected and TP53-mutated (8/8) patients was observed. Patients with both TP53 mutation and HPV infection had a significantly shorter disease-free interval than patients with HPV infection only (median 6 versus 31 months, respectively).ConclusionsTP53 mutations are associated with a higher risk of relapse and contribute to an even worse prognosis of patients with OSCC when the tumors are HPV infected. The shorter disease-free interval in patients with TP53 mutations indicates that the response to postoperative radiotherapy may be influenced by TP53 status. The presence of both HPV infection and TP53 mutations may define a particular group of tumors with a more aggressive phenotype in advanced OSCC. },

They are associated with a spectrum of diseases, from benign verrucae vulgares and condylomata acuminata to the malignancies of the cervix, vulva, anus, and penis. Disease associated with HPV can be divided into skin and mucosal lesion of the genital and extragenital regions. The relationship between HPV and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is important clinically, because NMSC is the most common form of malignancy among fair-skinned populations. HPVs have also been detected in skin tags, lichen sclerosus, seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses, epidermal cysts, psoriatic plaques, and plucked hairs, but cutaneous HPV can be found on healthy skin.},

Las infecciones por el VPH de riesgo alto que duran mucho tiempo a veces causan cáncer en las partes del cuerpo en que el VPH infecta las células. Por ejemplo, en el cuello uterino, la orofaringe (parte de la garganta detrás de la cavidad oral que incluye el tercio posterior de la lengua, el paladar blando, las paredes laterales y posteriores de la garganta, y las amígdalas), el ano, el pene, la vagina y la vulva. El VPH infecta las células escamosas que revisten las superficies internas de estos órganos. La mayoría de los cánceres relacionados con el VPH son un tipo de cáncer llamado carcinoma de células escamosas. Algunos cánceres de cuello uterino surgen de la infección por el VPH en las células glandulares del cuello uterino. Estos se llaman adenocarcinomas. Los cánceres relacionados con el VPH son los siguientes: Cáncer de cuello uterino: el VPH causa casi todos los cánceres de cuello uterino. Los exámenes de detección habituales previenen la mayoría de los cánceres de cuello uterino porque permiten a los médicos encontrar y extirpar las células precancerosas antes de que se vuelvan cancerosas. Por este motivo, las tasas de incidencia de cáncer de cuello uterino están en disminución en los Estados Unidos. Cánceres de orofaringe: la mayoría de estos cánceres que surgen en la garganta (por lo general, en las amígdalas o en la parte de atrás de la lengua) son a causa del VPH (el 70 % de los casos en los Estados Unidos). El número de casos nuevos de cánceres de orofaringe aumenta cada año y ahora son el tipo de cáncer relacionado con el VPH más frecuente en los Estados Unidos. Cáncer de ano: el VPH es la causa de más del 90 % de los cánceres de ano. Cada año aumenta el número de casos nuevos y de muertes por cáncer de ano. El cáncer de ano es casi dos veces más común en las mujeres que en los hombres. Cáncer de pene: el VPH es la causa de la mayoría de los cánceres de pene (más del 60 %). Para obtener más información sobre la importancia del tratamiento de este tipo de cáncer poco común, consulte Tratamiento del cáncer de pene (PDQ®). Cáncer de vagina: el VPH causa la mayoría de los cánceres de vagina (75 %). Para obtener más información sobre los síntomas y el tratamiento de este tipo de cáncer poco común, consulte Tratamiento del cáncer de vagina (PDQ®). Cáncer de vulva: el VPH causa la mayoría de los cánceres de vulva (70 %). En los Estados Unidos, los VPH de riesgo alto causan el 3 % de todos los cánceres en las mujeres y el 2 % de todos los cánceres en los hombres. Según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC), hay cerca de 45 000 casos nuevos de cáncer en partes del cuerpo donde el VPH se encuentra con frecuencia, y se calcula que alrededor de 36 000 de estos casos al año se deben al VPH. En todo el mundo, la carga de los cánceres relacionados con el VPH es mucho mayor. Los VPH de riesgo • • • • • •},

Objective To quantify the specific cutaneous phenotype observed in 46 individuals with Costello syndrome with confirmed HRAS mutations. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Dermatological surveys were designed by the authors and were completed by parents of mutation-positive individuals with CS at the Costello Syndrome Family Network (CSFN) conferences in 2007 and 2009. Dermatological examinations were performed by the authors at the CSFN conferences. Results Cutaneous papillomas were reported in 33 of the 46 (72%) participants, with age of onset ranging from infancy to 22 years. Individuals with CS are more likely than patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC) to present with cutaneous papillomas (72% vs. 5%, P < 0·001) and palmoplantar keratoderma (76% vs. 36%, P < 0·001). Individuals with CS are less likely than individuals with CFC to present with sparse or absent eyebrows (9% vs. 90%, P < 0·001) or keratosis pilaris (33% vs. 80%, P = 0·001).

Conclusions While there is significant phenotypic overlap among syndromes of the Ras/MAPK pathway, individuals with CS are more likely than individuals with CFC syndrome to present with cutaneous papillomas, palmoplantar keratoderma and full eyebrows, and are less likely to present with ulerythema ophryogenes, keratosis pilaris or multiple naevi.

	abstract = {Protein kinase B (AKT1) is hyper-activated in diverse human tumors. AKT1 is activated by phosphorylation at two key regulatory sites, Thr308 and Ser473. Active AKT1 phosphorylates many, perhaps hundreds, of downstream cellular targets in the cytosol and nucleus. AKT1 is well-known for phosphorylating proteins that regulate cell survival and apoptosis, however, the full catalog of AKT1 substrates remains unknown. Using peptide arrays, we recently discovered that each phosphorylated form of AKT1 (pAKT1S473, pAKT1T308, and ppAKT1S473,T308) has a distinct substrate specificity, and these data were used to predict potential new AKT1 substrates. To test the high-confidence predictions, we synthesized target peptides representing putative AKT1 substrates. Peptides substrates were synthesized by solid phase synthesis and their purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Most of the predicted peptides showed phosphate accepting activity similar to or greater than that observed with a peptide derived from a well-established AKT1 substrate, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β). Among the novel substrates, AKT1 was most active with peptides representing PIP3-binding protein Rab11 family-interacting protein 2 and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, indicating their potential role in AKT1-dependent cellular signaling. The ppAKT1S473,T308 enzyme was highly selective for peptides containing a patch of basic residues at −5, −4, −3 and aromatic residues (Phe/Tyr) at +1 positions from the phosphorylation site. The pAKT1S473 variant preferred more acidic peptides, Ser or Pro at +4, and was agnostic to the residue at −5. The data further support our hypothesis that Ser473 phosphorylation plays a key role in modulating AKT1 substrate selectivity.},

	abstract = {Germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunits B, C and D (SDHB, SDHC and SDHD), genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial complex II, cause hereditary paragangliomas and phaeochromocytomas. In SDHB (1p36)- and SDHC (1q21)-linked families, disease inheritance is autosomal dominant. In SDHD (11q23)-linked families, the disease phenotype is expressed only upon paternal transmission of the mutation, consistent with maternal imprinting. However, SDHD shows biallelic expression in brain, kidney and lymphoid tissues (Baysal et al., 2000). Moreover, consistent loss of the wild-type (wt) maternal allele in SDHD-linked tumours suggests expression of the maternal SDHD allele in normal paraganglia. Here we demonstrate exclusive loss of the entire maternal chromosome 11 in SDHD-linked paragangliomas and phaeochromocytomas, suggesting that combined loss of the wt SDHD allele and maternal 11p region is essential for tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that this is driven by selective loss of one or more imprinted genes in the 11p15 region. In paternally, but not in maternally derived SDHD mutation carriers, this can be achieved by a single event, that is, non-disjunctional loss of the maternal chromosome 11. Thus, the exclusive paternal transmission of the disease can be explained by a somatic genetic mechanism targeting both the SDHD gene on 11q23 and a paternally imprinted gene on 11p15.5, rather than imprinting of SDHD.},

Germline alterations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; PTEN-mut+), succinate dehydrogenase B/C/D (SDHB-D; SDHx-var+), and killin (KLLN-Me+) cause CS and Cowden syndrome-like (CSL) phenotypes. This study was aimed at identifying the prevalence and clinicopathologic predictors of germline PTEN-mut+, SDHx-var+, and KLLN-Me+ in CS/CSL patients presenting with endometrial cancer. METHODS: PTEN and SDHB-D mutation and KLLN promoter methylation analyses were performed for 371 prospectively enrolled patients (2005-2011). PTEN protein was analyzed from patient-derived lymphoblast lines. The PTEN Cleveland Clinic (CC) score is a weighted, regression-based risk calculator giving the a priori risk for PTEN-mut+. Demographic and clinicopathologic features were correlated with the specific gene. RESULTS: Germline PTEN-mut+, SDHx-var+, and KLLN-Me+ were found in 7%, 9.8%, and 10.5% of informative samples, respectively. Predictors of PTEN-mut+ included an age > 50 years (odds ratio [OR] for an age< 30 years, 6.1 [P = .015]; OR for an age of 30-50 years, 4.4 [P = .001]), macrocephaly (OR, 14.4; P< .001), a higher CC score (OR for a 1-U increment, 1.35; P< .001), a PTEN protein level within the lowest quartile (OR, 5.1; P = .039), and coexisting renal cancer (OR, 5.7; P = .002). KLLN-Me+ patients were on average 8 years younger than KLLN-Me-patients (44 vs 52 years, P = .018). Predictors of KLLN-Me + were a younger age and a higher CC score. On the other hand, no clinical predictors of SDH-var+ were found. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical predictors of PTEN and KLLN alterations, but not SDHx-var+, were identified. These predictors should alert the treating physician to potential heritable risk and the need for referral to genetic professionals. High-risk cancer surveillance and prophylactic surgery of the uterus may be considered for KLLN-Me+ patients similarly to PTEN-mut+ patients. Cancer 2015; 121:688-96.},

	abstract = {Accumulative structure or cluster-like shape is one of the important features of social networks. These structures and clusters are communities in a complex network and are fully detectable. Common group behaviors of different communities can be categorized using community detection methods. Categorize behavior allows the study of each part of the network to be done centrally. This paper uses trust-based centrality to detect the communities that make up the network. Centrality determines the relative importance of a node in the graph of social networks. Redefining the trust-based centrality makes it possible to change the position in the analysis of centrality and separates the local central nodes and global central nodes. Then, a trust-based algorithm is proposed to express the strength of trust penetration conceptually between nodes to extract communities in networks. This method has led to the achievement of a flexible and effective community detection method. The proposed algorithm is applied to four benchmark networks. The experiments consist of two independent parts. The first part is to use the proposed algorithm to detect clusters and communities. After that, the algorithm is compared with a Girvan–Newman inspired method. The second part is the implementation of the proposed algorithm with a large number of iterations with the aim of modularity maximization and comparing it with other community detection algorithms. Although, the modularity criterion has been used to validate and compare the solution quality in both independent parts of the experiments. The results show about 1.4–5.2% improvement in community detection.},

The traditional Louvain algorithm is a fast community detection algorithm with reliable results. The scale of complex networks is expanding larger all the time, and the efficiency of the Louvain algorithm will become lower. To improve the detection efficiency of large-scale networks, an improved Fast Louvain algorithm is proposed. The algorithm optimizes the iterative logic from the cyclic iteration to dynamic iteration, which speeds up the convergence speed and splits the local tree structure in the network. The split network is divided iteratively, then the tree structure is added to the partition results, and the results are optimized to reduce the computation. It has higher community aggregation, and the effect of community detection is improved. Through the experimental test of several groups of data, the Fast Louvain algorithm is superior to the traditional Louvain algorithm in partition effect and operation efficiency.},

Here, we present recent major extensions of the HPO for neurology, nephrology, immunology, pulmonology, newborn screening, and other areas. For example, the seizure subontology now reflects the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) guidelines and these enhancements have already shown clinical validity. We present new efforts to harmonize computational definitions of phenotypic abnormalities across the HPO and multiple phenotype ontologies used for animal models of disease. These efforts will benefit software such as Exomiser by improving the accuracy and scope of cross-species phenotype matching. The computational modeling strategy used by the HPO to define disease entities and phenotypic features and distinguish between them is explained in detail.We also report on recent efforts to translate the HPO into indigenous languages. Finally, we summarize recent advances in the use of HPO in electronic health record systems.},

In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data. The STRING resource is available online, at https://string-db.org/.},

	abstract = {Identifying communities of related nodes in networks is an essential tool enabling researchers to make sense of complex data sets. The linkcomm package greatly facilitates this process by extracting commu- nities of links from networks of arbitrary size and type. By clustering links, as opposed to nodes, it is possible for nodes to belong to multiple communities thereby revealing the overlapping and nested struc- ture of the network and uncovering the key nodes that form connections across several communities. In addition to this, linkcomm provides extensive functionality for visualizing and analysing the resulting link communities. linkcomm also provides tools for generating, visualizing, and analysing clusters generated by the Overlapping Cluster Generator (OCG) algorithm.

@article{Kechagias2022,
   abstract = {Objective: To explore the efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on the risk of HPV infection and recurrent diseases related to HPV infection in individuals undergoing local surgical treatment. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Data sources: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were screened from inception to 31 March 2021. Review methods: Studies reporting on the risk of HPV infection and recurrence of disease related to HPV infection after local surgical treatment of preinvasive genital disease in individuals who were vaccinated were included. The primary outcome measure was risk of recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) after local surgical treatment, with follow-up as reported by individual studies. Secondary outcome measures were risk of HPV infection or other lesions related to HPV infection. Independent and in duplicate data extraction and quality assessment were performed with ROBINS-I and RoB-2 tools for observational studies and randomised controlled trials, respectively. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was implemented for the primary outcome. Observational studies and randomised controlled trials were analysed separately from post hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials. Pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with a random effects meta-analysis model. The restricted maximum likelihood was used as an estimator for heterogeneity, and the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method was used to derive confidence intervals. Results: 22 articles met the inclusion criteria of the review; 18 of these studies also reported data from a non-vaccinated group and were included in the meta-analyses (12 observational studies, two randomised controlled trials, and four post hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials). The risk of recurrence of CIN2+ was reduced in individuals who were vaccinated compared with those who were not vaccinated (11 studies, 19 909 participants; risk ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.60; I2=58%, τ2=0.14, median follow-up 36 months, interquartile range 24-43.5). The effect estimate was even stronger when the risk of recurrence of CIN2+ was assessed for disease related to HPV subtypes HPV16 or HPV18 (six studies, 1879 participants; risk ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.43; I2=0%, τ2=0). Confidence in the meta-analysis for CIN2+ overall and CIN2+ related to HPV16 or HPV18, assessed by GRADE, ranged from very low to moderate, probably because of publication bias and inconsistency in the studies included in the meta-analysis. The risk of recurrence of CIN3 was also reduced in patients who were vaccinated but uncertainty was large (three studies, 17 757 participants; 0.28, 0.01 to 6.37; I2=71%, τ2=1.23). Evidence of benefit was lacking for recurrence of vulvar, vaginal, and anal intraepithelial neoplasia, genital warts, and persistent and incident HPV infections, although the number of studies and participants in each outcome was low. Conclusion: HPV vaccination might reduce the risk of recurrence of CIN, in particular when related to HPV16 or HPV18, in women treated with local excision. GRADE assessment for the quality of evidence indicated that the data were inconclusive. Large scale, high quality randomised controlled trials are required to establish the level of effectiveness and cost of HPV vaccination in women undergoing treatment for diseases related to HPV infection.

   abstract = {Among human tumorigenic viruses, the role of Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been proven as one of the most important oncoviruses that are associated with a large number of cancers. Most cancers of the genital area such cervical and anal cancer as are caused by HPV, and in many other cancers, such as colorectal, gastric, liver, esophageal, urinary bladder, and head and neck cancers, it is considered as one of the important risk factors. Our search was conducted for published researches between 2000 and 2022 by using several international databases including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science as well as Google scholar. We also evaluated additional evidence from relevant published articles. It has been demonstrated that HPV can promote tumorigenesis via focusing on genes, proteins, and signaling pathways, by using E6 and E7 oncoproteins and inhibiting two crucial tumor suppressors, P53 and Rb. The following study was performed to investigate different malignant cancers under the influence of HPV infection and changes in molecular factors caused by HPV infection.},
